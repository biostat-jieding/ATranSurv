# ATransHPH
This is an R package that focuses on aggregate information transfer-assisted estimation and inference for high-dimensional Cox proportional hazards model.

Briefly speaking, this package can implement the following cases:
- Low-dimensional Cox proportional hazards model:
  - with subgroup group survival probabilities as auxiliary information (AuxSP-Low)
  - with estimates from fitted submodels as auxiliary information (AuxCE-Low)
- High-dimensional Cox proportional hazards model:
  - with subgroup group survival probabilities as auxiliary information (AuxSP-Low)
  - with estimates from fitted submodels as auxiliary information (AuxCE-Low)



We will add more details in the near future. Thank you for your attention!
