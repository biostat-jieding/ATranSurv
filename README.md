This is an R package that focuses on auxiliary information transfer learning-assisted estimation and inference for both low and high dimensional Cox proportional hazards models.

Briefly speaking, this package can implement the following cases:
- **Low-dimensional** Cox proportional hazards model:
  - with **subgroup survival probabilities at multiple time points** as auxiliary information (SP-Low)
- **High-dimensional** Cox proportional hazards model:
  - with **subgroup group survival probabilities at multiple time points** as auxiliary information (SP-High)

Survival data analysis from various perspectives is also of interest: 
- **Estimation**: Estimation of potentially prognostic effects for interested risk factors
- **Inference**: Hypothesis testings towards prognostic effects
- **Prediction**: Prognostic prediction based on pure risks

We will add more details in the near future. Thank you for your attention!
