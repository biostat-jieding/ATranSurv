This is an R package that focuses on auxiliary information transfer learning-assisted estimation and inference for both low and high dimensional Cox proportional hazards models.

Briefly speaking, this package can implement the following cases:
- **Low-dimensional** Cox proportional hazards model:
  - with **subgroup survival probabilities at multiple time points** as auxiliary information (AuxSP-Low)
- **High-dimensional** Cox proportional hazards model:
  - with **subgroup group survival probabilities at multiple time points** as auxiliary information (AuxSP-High)



We will add more details in the near future. Thank you for your attention!
